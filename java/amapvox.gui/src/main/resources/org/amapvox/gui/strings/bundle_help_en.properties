help_output_variables=Select the output variables that are to write in the voxel file.
help_bbox=Automatic calculation of the extremums given a set of points (ALS only).\n\
Fast option choice read the extremums in header file (als, laz).\n\
In case where an additional transformation is set (VOP matrix), the option behaviour will be the same as the \u00ab\u00a0Deep search\u00bb option.\n\
\u00ab\u00a0Deep search\u00a0\u00bb option choice read all points from the file, apply a VOP matrix if there is any and does filtering by classification as defined in the tab \u00ab\u00a0Filter\u00a0\u00bb \u2192 \u00ab\u00a0Other\u00a0\u00bb.
help_hemiphoto=The tab "From hemi scans" mean that the hemispherical photography is generated from the lidar scans.\n\
The scans should be at the same position.\n\
The most important is to have an hemispherical cover.\n\n\
The tab "From PAD" allows you to generate an hemispherical photography from a voxel file, using the PAD values.
help_empty_shots_filter= Artificial empty shots may be provided by Riegl TLS scanners for objects too close to the sensor (around 1m).\n\
This option allows to remove those "false" empty shots.
help_3D_viewer=The mode 1 allows you to visualize a voxel space file selected in the bottom right list.\n\
You can also display a raster in ascii grid format (*.asc) at the same time as the voxel file.\n\n\
The mode 2 is a new more flexible 3d item viewer. You can display in it as many element as you want.\n\
The supported formats right now are : \n\
\t-Rasters :\n\
\t\t-Ascii grid format (*.asc)\n\n\
\t-Point clouds:\n\
\t\t-rxp, rsp\n\
\t\t-las, laz\n\
\t\t-ptx, ptg\n\
\t\t-csv file (values separated by columns)\n\n\
\t-Voxel file: it is inadisable, use mode 1 for this purpose\n\n
las_file=Las file
laz_file=Laz file
xyz_file=Points file (unavailable)
shots_file=Shots file
open_image=Open image
info=Info
edit=Edit
export=Export
open_containing_folder=Open containing folder
help_shot_decimation=Randomly downsample the scan by a float factor M ranging inside [0, 1[, the decimation factor. M = 0 means no shot discarded, M = 0.1 means 10% of the shots discarded, etc.
help_shot_attribute_filter=Discard or retain a shot based on numerical assumptions about its attributes.
help_shot_angle_filter=Filter shots based on shot Zenith angle (also called polar angle) in degrees, i.e angle between zenith (origin at the ground) and shot direction.
help_shot_consistency=Discard shots with inconsistent echo ranges.\n\n\
1. make sure there are not any blank echo (range == 0) interlaid in between two valid echoes.\n\
2. check that echo ranges are monotonically increasing.\n\
3. optional: discard any shot with blank echo.\n\
Tip: always apply the filter on first run, check whether AMAPVox returns any warning about suspicious echoes and disable it if the shots are flawless to avoid unnecessary computation.\n\n\
Note: checks 1 & 2 cannot be disabled because such flawed shots would prejudice the voxelisation algorithm.
help_transmittance_numerical_estimation=Accurate numerical estimation of the transmittance is achieved by keeping in heap memory records of every ray crossing a voxel. In some cases (TLS for instance) there are so many shots that heap memory is limiting and transmittance is estimated with a different approach (fallback mode): estimation is computed on the fly for a predetermined set of transmittance values and best estimation is returned in the end. In fallback mode, memory cost is lighten but computational cost increases, that's why accuracy must be limited.\n\
Switch to fallback mode occurs independently for every voxel and is triggered by the maximum number of records to be kept in memory in one voxel.
help_transmittance_error=Precision of the numerical estimation of the transmittance.
help_transmittance_fallback_error=Fallback mode, number of fraction digits in the numerical estimation of the transmittance.\n\
Warning: increasing the precision by one order of magnitude will multiply by 10 the computational and memory costs in a given voxel.
help_transmittance_nrecordmax=Maximum number of ray records in a voxel for switching to fallback mode.\n\
Zero disables the fallback mode, meaning that AMAPVox will record every ray crossing a voxel for estimating the transmittance.
help_output_format=Choose output file format:\n\
* VOXEL, text-based format;\n\
* NETCDF, scientific array-oriented binary format (beta).
help_fraction_digits=Set the number of fraction digits in the voxel file.
help_leaf_area=Single leaf characteristic area in the scene (square meter). Enabled for computing the attenuation coefficient (@see Output tab).
help_subvoxel_division=Sub voxel division factor (integer > 1) used for computing the sub voxel exploration rate. E.g. value = 3 means the voxel is subdivided into 3^3=27 sub voxels; value = 4 => 4^3=64 sub voxels. 
help_rank_echo_weight=Energy attenuation model along a shot with multiple echoes. The array must be read by line:\n\
* 1st line quantifies energy attenuation for a shot with single echo.\n\
* 2nd line quantifies energy attenuation for a shot with two echoes.\n\
* etc.\n\
Default values assume that energy is evenly absorbed by echoes. Same as "Equal echo weight" option
help_equal_echo_weight=Energy is evenly absorbed by echoes.
help_relative_echo_weight=Energy is absorbed proportionally to relative fraction of selected echo attribute, usually intensity or reflectance.\n\
Weight normalization can be disabled and in such case selected echo attribute is directly used as echo weight. AMAPVox does not perform any check on the attribute value.
help_strongest_echo_weight=Only keep strongest echo. Strongest means here max value of selected echo attribute, usually intensity or reflectance.
help_las_collinearity=Discard shots whose echoes are not collinear. The maximal deviation is a tolerance in degree to strict collinearity.
help_las_consistency= Check whether a subset of LAS points with same GPS time is consistent in terms of echo rank and number of echoes. Every LAS point of the subset should have a unique echo rank and the same number of echoes.
help_skip_empty_voxel=Do not write empty voxel in the output file
help_path_length_export=Export list of path lengths in each voxel to HDF5 output file (Careful it may generate big files).\n\
HDF5 files is automatically generated in the output folder with .h5 file extension.
help_path_length_max_size=Number of path lengths (float numbers) per voxel to retain in heap memory before flushing them to the HDF5 output file. 
help_byattribute_echo_filter=For RXP scans only, filter echoes based on reflectance, amplitude or deviation values.
help_byclass_echo_filter=LAS points are usually classified. Deselect the classes that should be discarded from the voxelisation.
help_max_attenuation=Attenuation coefficient is estimated by dichotomy over a predefined range [0 maxAttenuation].
help_attenuation_error=Precision of the numerical estimation of the attenuation.
help_cubic_voxel=Voxels are either cubic (vx==vy==vz) or cuboid (vx, vy & vz may differ)
help_dtm=Digital Terrain Model is optional. If provided it will be used to compute distance to ground.\n\
Required if DTM filter (section Filter > DTM filter) or Ground energy output (section Output > Post-processing) are enabled. 
help_dtm_filter=Digital Terrain Model filter discards every point that are below a given distance to the ground (the Offset parameter in meter). Enabling this filter implies that a Digital Terrain Model has been provided in the Input section.
help_scans=Select lidar scan(s) in the following format:\n\
* RIEGL single RXP scan or RSP project.\n\
* LAS/LAZ scan\n\
* PTG or PTX scans\n\
* XYB (or XYZ) binary format\n\
* SHT text-based format.\n\
SHT text-based format is described in ...
help_scanner_position=Scanner head position can be provided either as a trajectory text file for mobile scanner or a fixed position.\n\
Trajectory file is text file with at least four columns: TIME, X, Y, Z. Separator, column names, header size, etc. are customable.\n\
Scanner positions must be expressed in the same Coordinate Reference System as the scans. VOP matrix will be applied to the scanner position.
help_pad_variable=PAD variable must be estimated with AMAPVox R package AMAPVox::plantAreaDensity https://amapvox.org/reference/plantAreaDensity.html
help_leaf_angle_distribution=Details about leaf angle distributions can be found at https://amapvox.org/reference/computeG.html
help_las_time_range=Trim point cloud based on user-defined time range. Time in seconds, same origin as LAS/LAZ file.\n\
AMAPVox does not fill default values because it would imply to scan the whole point cloud which may be slow.\n\
From R: range(lidR::readLAS('file.laz')$gpstime)
