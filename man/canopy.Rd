\title{Extract canopy from voxel space.}
\usage{
canopy(vxsp, hit.min = 1)

belowCanopy(vxsp, hit.min = 1)

aboveCanopy(vxsp, hit.min = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{vxsp}{a \code{\link{VoxelSpace-class}} object.}

\item{hit.min}{a positive integer, minimum number of hit/echo in a voxel
to consider it contains vegetation.}
}
\value{
\link[data.table:data.table-class]{data.table::data.table} object with voxel index either
below canopy, canopy level or above canopy
}
\description{
Extract canopy from \code{\link{VoxelSpace-class}} object.
The canopy layer is the set of highest voxels with number of hits greater
than a user-defined threshold.
\subsection{Minimum number of hits/echos}{

Minimum number of hits is set by default to one, meaning that a single echo
in a voxel is enough to consider that there is some vegetation. Increasing
this threshold will tend to lower the canopy level or introduce some gaps (
i-j-cells with no vegetation). This \code{hit.min} filter is stronger than
\link{butterfly} since is does not discriminate isolated voxels.
A reasonable value for \code{hit.min} cannot be suggested ad-hoc since it
strongly depends on sampling intensity. Removing butterflies prior to
extracting canopy is advisable.
}

\subsection{Gaps}{

For a VoxelSpace with fully defined ground level (see \link{ground}),
missing canopy cells can be interpreted as gaps. Conversely if both ground
and canopy are missing for a i-j-cell, then it is inconclusive.

Function \code{aboveCanopy} returns voxel index above canopy level (excluded).

Function \code{belowCanopy} returns voxel index below canopy level (included).
